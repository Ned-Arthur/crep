# crep
A simple grep clone. Search one file for one pattern, and be happy.

## INSTALL:

1. Place the 'crep' application in a folder included in your $PATH variable.
For example place in `~/bin` and add to your .bashrc `PATH=~/bin:$PATH`

2. Place the 'crep.1.gz' file (the `man` page) in a directory man knows.
By default this will be `/usr/share/man/man1` or `/usr/local/share/man/man1`.
You will need root privelages to do this.

3. Now you have access to the `crep` command to use the tool, and the `man crep` command will show the man page.
